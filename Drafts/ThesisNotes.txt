Notes:

email or meeting with jay
	- how did he deal with records containing NaN


DATA PROCESSING:

Changes to dataset:
-removed the last month record, too many missing values need to find
-seperated the data set into two files, 2018_Attributes, 2018_Targets


DATA COLLECTION:
some data sets are revised as better estimates for indexes are made
for example CSUSHPINSA 
	- need to update the entire column?


Tasks:

*Timestampe Formatting! DONE!

*Columns with NaN:
use real data and linear regression to predict missing values:

MODELS:

implement feature selection

try to reduce time back to 1997 cause of taxes in east coast?

Linear Regression by Year
use X to 2013 to predict 2014
use X to 2014 to predict 2015
use X to 2015 to predict 2016
use X to 2016 to predict 2017
use X to 2017 to predict 2018

PLOTS:
need script to compute title dates
need to show months on x axis and $ values on y axis



BAGGING!
- take each year from 99 to 16 (or beyond 99)
	make a linear regression model for each 
	- so 17 models, use that on the food17
	- take the average of all 17 models.


- training set of model is 99 to that year, test is that year

- get the mean squared error on the test.

- use each of the 17 models on the most recent year 2017, 
- take average.
-take weighted average, where weights are the mean squared error.

further: make the years that are most similar to the current year worth more in the vote


What to add to the paper:

- why did i use python
-why did i use scikit
- why did i use linear regression
- mention of limits of regression on timeseries data
- need a lot more in the linear regression
